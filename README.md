### Hi! ðŸ‘‹

I'm Steven, a dev on Xbox at Microsoft, currently focused on our mobile apps and social experiences.

When I'm not working I am still a TypeScript + React fan and likely learning whatever fun new tech I can get my hands on for personal projects (like Foundry VTT plugins for my D&D campaign).
